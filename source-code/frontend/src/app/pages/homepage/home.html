                <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is an ancient game, with boards etched in Egyptian stone (c. 1300 BC) 
                    and a Roman cousin called “terni lapilli,” played with small pebbles rather than written Xs and Os. 
                    The name “Tic-Tac-Toe” emerged in 19th-century England for a children’s pen-and-paper pastime; 
                    the X-and-O format spread widely in early-20th-century America. Simple rules, lasting appeal: 
                    from school notebooks to computer labs, it’s still used to teach strategy, logic, and the fundamentals 
                    of algorithms and artificial intelligence.</p>
