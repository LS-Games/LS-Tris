                <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the oldest games in the world. 
                    Versions of it were played as early as 1300 BC in ancient Egypt, 
                    where boards scratched into stone have been discovered. 
                    The Romans had their own version too, called “terni lapilli”, 
                    played with small pebbles instead of X’s and O’s.
                    The modern name “Tic-Tac-Toe” comes from the 19th century in England, 
                    originally referring to a children’s game involving writing and ticking. 
                    In the United States, the familiar X’s and O’s version became popular in the early 20th century.
                    Despite being a very simple game, Tic-Tac-Toe has fascinated people for thousands of years. 
                    It’s often the first “strategy” game we learn as kids, and it has even been 
                    used in computer science as a teaching tool for artificial intelligence and algorithms.</p>
